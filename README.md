# Hi, I'm Hugo! 👨‍💻

I'm a full-time student-athlete with a passion for cybersecurity and software development. When I'm not on the field, you’ll find me working on cool projects like building a NAS with Raspberry Pi or setting up VMs! 💻

🌱 Currently diving deep into **Kali Linux** and **Threat Intelligence** tools while learning more about **automation**.

## What I'm Into:
- **IT & Software Development**
  - Programming in **Python, Java, C++, Bash, React**
- **Information Security**
  - **Network & Communication** (Wireshark, Palo Alto)
  - **Database Admin & Vulnerability Management** (Tenable, Rapid7)
  - **Risk Management & Auditing** (OneTrust, Power BI, Azure)
  - **Threat Intelligence & VM Automation**

This is the stuff I love and what I’m working on now, with a big focus on **automation**. Feel free to connect with me below!
